## 🎨 UI Inspiration / Credits

The UI design and layout were inspired by
the [Mobile UI Kit – Ecommerce & Community](https://www.figma.com/design/TQ4qODI5LVHWdWRGoPA798/Mobile-UI-Kit--Ecommerce--Community-?node-id=47-3104&t=Wxzjq12qRCUZHtqr-0)
on Figma.

All code, structure, and animations were implemented independently in React Native for learning and portfolio purposes.
